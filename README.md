Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using NLP Models

- Sentiment analysis has been applied to the Twitter dataset, which was sourced from Kaggle.

- The initial dataset consisted of 1.65 million records, which was further reduced during text preprocessing based on the length of the tweets.

- Implemented models like CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words), Skip-Gram, CountVectorizer, and TF-IDF to predict the sentiment of the tweets.

- Since the dataset is almost balanced, accuracy metrics have been used for model evaluation.
